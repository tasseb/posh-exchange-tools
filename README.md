Hello World, I am following the GitHub guide for the creation of my first repository... 
Sorry for english people but I wrote comments in french for this one, in order to share it with my acutal company.
I guess I will update it in english asap!
If I have to tell about my self, I would say that I love to script, but I love real life too, that's why I stay a beginner in IT stuff I guess :)
